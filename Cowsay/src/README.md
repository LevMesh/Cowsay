Hey Everyone! My name is Lev Meshorer. And this is Foodtrucks project:)

What I've done in this project?

I've Built the Dockerfile (Dockerized the webapp)
I Wrote an initialization script which builds the docker image and asks for port, if port is already in use, sets the port for default 8080.

now, please run init-cowsay.sh script, and that's it!

Awesome! Everything should be up and running in the address http://localhost:8080

for any problem in the project, feel free to contact me at any time! via Levmeshorer16@gmail.com
